        <p>The lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is one of the five big cats in the genus <em>Panthera</em> and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies found in Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger.</p>
        <p>Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India). Lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, lions were widespread across Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.</p>
        <p>The lion is a vulnerable species. Populations have declined significantly due to habitat loss and human conflict. In Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.</p>

        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier.</p>
