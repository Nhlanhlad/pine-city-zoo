        <h3>PANDA</h3>
        <p>The giant panda (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>), also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by its large, distinctive black patches around the eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.</p>
        <p>Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. In the wild, they occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even small animals. In captivity, pandas may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, oranges, or bananas, along with specially prepared food.</p>
        <p>Pandas live in mountain ranges mainly in Sichuan, China. Due to deforestation and farming, they have been driven from lowland areas. The giant panda is a conservation-reliant endangered species.</p>
