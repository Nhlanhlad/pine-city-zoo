        <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
        <p><em>Phacochoerus</em> is a genus of wild pigs known as warthogs. They are found in open and semi-open habitats in sub-Saharan Africa, including arid regions. There are two species: the desert warthog and the common warthog.</p>
        <p>Warthogs appear mostly hairless from a distance, except for a crest along the back and tufts on the cheeks and tail. The name "warthog" refers to their facial wattles, most prominent in males. They also have long, curved tusks — males’ can reach up to 63.5 cm.</p>
        <p>They are largely herbivorous but occasionally eat small animals. The Cape warthog, a subspecies of the desert warthog, became extinct around 1865, but most other warthogs are still common and not considered endangered.</p>

        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.</p>
